  I’m <strong>Chaymae Jaouhar</strong>, a Data &amp; AI consultant in the TMT industry and I am developing a research
  trajectory with interests in AI Safety Evaluation, Mechanistic Interpretability and Human–AI interactions.
  With LLMs becoming a major part of modern life, I became interested in this field to better understand
  these systems that are now part of my life and my work.
</p>

<p>
  My ambition is to actively contribute through research to the general understanding of model behavior,
  AI safety, fairness, and “inclusive” AI alignment across different linguistic communities.
</p>

<p>
  This website contains my active research, write-ups and experiment logs about the research landscape I am exploring.
  <em>Please note that my research is independent of my corporate activity.</em>

  My personal e-mail is : chaymaejawhar at gmail dot com

## Sections

[**Research**](research.md)  
Write-ups of experiments and findings. Please note that the research papers I shared are not yet submitted for publication and the "Research" page reflects only the experiments I formally consolidated; additional raw experimental content may follow.

[**Research Log**](log.md)  
Weekly notes and observations ( a later addition) : This section will compile my notes/assumptions before conducting research, post-research notes and how my understanding and assumptions evolve over the lifecycle of my experiments.
